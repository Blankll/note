1 教育陪伴我们每个人的一生，而我们每一个人也都是教育的见证者和经历者，在我经历了16年的教育后，今天我想和大家分享一些我的所见所感，

2 毋庸置疑，教育对每一个人都是至关重要的，在我看来，教育最重要的是帮助每一个人去寻找why exists and how exists的答案

3 对于中国的教育，大家最熟知的就是九年义务教育，高考这些我们其中很多人都曾经历过的制度，也是我们很多人共同的回忆. 我们的国家投入了大量的资源用于提高教育基础设施和教学质量，幸运的是，我也是中国教育质量提升的一名见证者

4 十六年前，当我第一次踏入学校时，我的学校长这个样子，我在这里度过了我前4年的小学生涯，在这里，一名老师带着我们10个学生，他是所有课程的老师，也是我们的校长

5 十六年后的今天，小学已经变成了照片上的那样，虽然和城市的学校还有些差距，但是相较于之前，基础设施有了很大的改善，

6 但是，城乡教育基础设施依旧存在着一些明显的差距。因为农村教育基础设施在发展的同时，城市的教育设施也在快速发展

7 更为令人担忧的是城乡教学水平和教师资源的差距， 很难有优秀的教师来到乡村，投身于乡村教育，

8  很多人都希望在大城市和经济较为发达的地区就业和生活，包括教师也是如此。经济发展的不平衡一定程度上造成了教学质量的不平衡

9 根据中国教育部发布的2019年教育统计数据，全国共有农村小学88631所，占全国学校数55.3% ，农村小学生3208万人

Data from Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China

10 在农村中小学中，年纪偏大的教师较多，这些教师教学经验丰富，但教育方式落后，教学质量存在很大问题。

11 所以，即使到了今天，我们的城乡教学水平不仅仅在基础设施上有差距，更为致命的是我们的教学水平也存在着难以平衡的差距。

12 那么，对于这些问题，我们又采取了哪些措施去改进，又有哪些革新值得我们期待和投入努力呢？

13 在政府层面，近年来通过大量的激励性政策鼓励毕业大学生向教育资源匮乏的地区发展，三支一扶，特岗教师等，向教育资源匮乏地区注入新鲜的血液

14 在非政府层面，近几年我们也可以看到，线上教育，远程教育的蓬勃发展，同时，作为一个dev，我也十分对于线上教育寄予很大的期望

15 在大学期间，我曾参加过一个关于在线学习的项目，我们构建了一个简单的在线学习软件，让人们可以随时随地的使用智能设备进行学习

16 就是在这样一个简陋的学习平台里，我看到了技术可以带给教育的一些改变和可能。

17 在今天看来，蓬勃发展的线上教育，远程课堂以及海量的线上学习资源，确实为所有人都提供了一个新的学习入口，带去了新的希望与可能性

18 幸运的是，日趋完善的网络基础设施也为线上教育等提供了保证，如4G网络的广泛覆盖以及即将到来的5G，智能手机等设备保有量的不断增加，为偏远的山区获取教学资源提供了一种新的途径

19 同样的，在中小学网络基础设施建设中，全国普通小学接入互联网的学校比例97.82%，全国初中接入互联网的学校比例98.96%; 也为线上教育提供了保证

Our country has invested a lot of resources to improve the education base Facilities and teaching quality. Fortunately, I am also a witness to the improvement of education quality in China



1 today I want to share some of my observations and feelings about education. Education accompanies each of us throughout our lives, and each of us is also a witness and experiencer of education. 

2 Undoubtedly, education is very important for everyone. In my opinion, the most important thing about education is to help everyone find the answer about why exists and how exists

3 As for education in China, I guess many of us are familiar with the nine-year compulsory education and The college entrance examination just like me, and many of us have experienced that, a common memory for many of us. 

4 16 years ago, when I first stepped into school, my Primary school looked like this. I spent my first 4 years at this school. A teacher with 10 students, He is the teacher of all courses and also our principal

5 And 16 years later, the primary school has become as shown in the photo. Although there is still some gap with the Urban Area school, the infrastructure has been greatly improved compared to before.

6 However, there are still some obvious gaps between urban and rural education infrastructure. During the development of rural education infrastructure, urban education facilities are also developing rapidly

7 The more worrying thing is the gap between urban and rural teaching quality and teacher resources. It is difficult for new generation teachers to come to the countryside to devote themselves to rural education.

8 Many people want to work and live in urban areas and economically developed areas, including teachers. The imbalance in economic development is one of the main reasons for  imbalance in teaching quality.

9 this is the 2019 education statistics, there are 88,631 rural primary schools across our country, accounting for 55.3% of the country’s total number of schools, but only have 30.6% of teachers in these schools

10 In rural primary schools and secondary schools, there are many older teachers. These teachers have rich teaching experience, but their education methods are lagging,  teaching quality is not well.

11 Therefore, even now, there is not only a gap between our urban and rural teaching infrastructure but also a gap in our teaching quality which is a more fatal issue.

12 So, what measures have we taken to improve these problems?
	what innovations are we looking forward to solving these problems?
	I would like to show some my opinion of these questions

13 At the government level, in these years, many incentive policies have published to encourage graduating college students into areas with low educational resources. inject fresh blood into areas with low educational resources

14 At the non-governmental level, in recent years, we can also see the huge development of online education and distance education.  and as a dev, I  have great expectations for online education.

15 during my university, I joined a project about online learning. We built a simple app that allows people to use smart devices to learn anytime, anywhere

16 It is such a simple learning platform, but I think I have seen some changes and possibilities that technology can bring to education. and I think there are  a lot of potentials wait for people to discover

17 From my perspective, the booming online education, remote classrooms, and massive online learning resources have provided everyone with a new learning entrance, bringing new hopes and possibilities for our education

18  and also, the increasing network infrastructure guarantees online education. like the extensive coverage of 4G networks and the upcoming 5G, increasingly  smartphones and other devices provide a new way for rural students to obtain learning resources

19 Similarly,  about network infrastructure in primary and secondary schools, about 98% of the primary schools and secondary school have access to the Internet, it also provides a guarantee for online education and remote classroom
